## Outreach Scripts

### Cold Call Script (Primary)
```
"Hi, is this [Owner Name] with The Valley Pool Resurfacing?

Hey, my name is [YOUR NAME]. I'll be straight with you -
I run a lead generation website for pool resurfacing in Phoenix.
I just launched phxpoolresurfacing.com and I'm looking for
ONE reliable contractor to partner with for exclusive leads.

I noticed you're newer in the market - which is actually perfect.
I can help you get established with consistent leads from
organic Google traffic.

Quick question - have you ever received leads from a lead
generation service before?"

[Listen to their answer]

"Got it. Well here's what makes this different - the leads
would be 100% exclusive to you. No competing with 5 other
contractors like Thumbtack. These are people actively
searching Google for pool resurfacing in Phoenix.

Would you be open to me sending you a few test leads so
you can see the quality?"
```

### Voicemail Script
```
"Hey, this is [YOUR NAME]. I run a pool resurfacing lead
generation website in Phoenix and I'm looking for one
contractor to partner with exclusively.

interested in getting some qualified leads.

Give me a call back at [YOUR NUMBER] - I'd love to send
you a few to test the quality. Thanks!"
```

### Text/SMS Follow-up

## Discovery Questions

Once you have them on the phone, ask:

1. **"How are you currently getting your leads?"**
   - Tells you their current pain points

2. **"Are you paying for leads anywhere right now? Thumbtack, Google Ads, HomeAdvisor?"**
   - If yes = they understand lead value = easy sell
   - If frustrated = they need a better solution

3. **"What's your typical job worth? Average pool resurfacing?"**
   - Helps you price your leads appropriately

4. **"If I started sending you qualified leads, could you handle the extra volume?"**
   - Confirms they have capacity

5. **"What area do you service?"**
   - Confirm alignment with your site's service areas

## Handling Objections

### "I'm already getting enough leads"
```
"That's great to hear. If that ever changes, I'd love to
connect. I'm only working with one contractor in Phoenix,
so the spot may not be open later. But I'll keep your info
in case things change on my end too."
```
[Move on - some will call back when things slow down]

### "I've been burned by lead gen services before"
```
"I hear that a lot, and I totally get it. Most services
send the same lead to 5 different contractors and the
quality is trash.

Here's how this is different - you'd be the ONLY contractor
getting these leads. They come from an organic website,
not paid ads, so these are people actively searching and
ready to hire.

I'm happy to prove it - let me send you a few leads with
no commitment and you tell me if the quality is there."
```

### "How much does this cost?"
```
"It depends on the value of jobs in your market. My goal
is for you to see at least a 10x return on whatever you
pay me.

What's a typical pool resurfacing job worth for you?
And what's your rough margin on that? That'll help me
figure out a number that works for both of us."
```

### "Send me some information"
```
"Absolutely. What's the best email? I'll send you a quick
overview.

Just know I'm only looking for one partner in Phoenix,
so if you're interested, let's connect soon before I
move on to someone else."
```

## Building the Relationship

### Phase 1: Trial Period (First 5-10 Leads)
- Send leads individually
- Follow up after each: "Did that lead turn into a job?"
- Track everything: date, job type, outcome
- Don't charge much (or anything) - prove value first

### Phase 2: Per-Lead Pricing
Once quality is proven:
- Pool resurfacing avg: $5,000-$8,000
- Your fee: 5-10% = $250-$800 per closed lead
- Start at 10%, back down to 5% if needed

### Phase 3: Monthly Rental
After consistent volume:
- "Instead of per-lead, how about $750/month flat?"
- Show the math: "Last month I sent you 8 leads, you closed 3 for ~$18,000. $750 is less than 5%."
- Set up auto-forwarding through Call Rail
- Monthly invoice or auto-payment

---

## Red Flags - Walk Away

- Poor Google reviews or BBB complaints
- Slow to respond (they'll ghost your leads too)
- Hostile toward "marketing people"
- Already overwhelmed with work (no capacity)
- Unprofessional communication
- Wants to negotiate before seeing any value

---

## Notes on Phoenix Market

- Year-round pool season = consistent demand
- Winter is actually BEST resurfacing season (pools not in use)
- High-end areas: Paradise Valley, North Scottsdale, Arcadia
- Growing suburbs: Gilbert, Chandler, Queen Creek
- Massive HOA presence = constant pool maintenance requirements
